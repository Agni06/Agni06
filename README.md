Inventory Management:

Efficiently manages inventory levels of coffee beans, milk, and other ingredients. Alerts users when supplies are running low, ensuring a seamless coffee-making experience.
Payment System:

Simulates a straightforward payment system. Users "pay" for their selected coffee, and the program calculates the total cost based on chosen options.
Error Handling:

Implements robust error handling for scenarios like insufficient ingredients or invalid inputs, providing a smooth and error-free user experience.
How to Run:
Download and Run:

Clone or download the program from the GitHub repository.
Execute the main Python file, e.g., python main.py, in the terminal or command prompt.
